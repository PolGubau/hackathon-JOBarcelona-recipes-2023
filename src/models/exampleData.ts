      instructions:
        "Combine milk, sugar and salt in a saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until mixture almost boils. Reduce heat to low.\nBeat the eggs with a hand mixer or a whisk for 2 minutes until frothy.\nGradually stir about  cup of hot milk mixture into beaten eggs.\nAdd eggs to remaining milk mixture.\nCook over low heat, stirring constantly until slightly thickened, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat\nWhisk in peanut butter and mix well.\nRefrigerate at least 3 hours.\nCombine cream, vanilla extract, and chilled mixture, stirring with a whisk.\nPour the mixture into an ice cream machine and churn until frozen. Transfer to plastic container and place in the freezer for an hour before serving.\nServing: take it out of the freezer for 5-10 minutes before serving, or longer, so it comes to the right scooping temperature. Sprinkle with chopped peanuts and chocolate bits.\nEasy suggestion: ice cream is best served in chilled glass or porcelain bowls. Scoop it with a hot, but dry, ice-cream spoon (soak it in boiling water, then wipe dry).",

        "Lay the clean, drained berries in a single layer on a cookie sheet and place in the freezer until frozen through. It is best to do both this and the next step the day or night before you plan to make the sorbet - just make sure you leave enough time for everything to freeze.\nMake the herb-infused simple syrup by combining the water and sugar in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat over a medium flame until it comes to a boil. Turn it off and let cool completely.\nStrain out the mint leaves and lavender and pour the cooled syrup into an ice cube tray - should make roughly 4 syrup cubes. Place the tray in the freezer until syrup is frozen (the cubes may remain a little mushy as a result of all the sugar.)\nOnce the berries and herb-infused syrup cubes have frozen, you can make the sorbet. Place the frozen berries and syrup cubes in the bowl of a cuisinart or blender and add a few teaspoons of ice water to aid in blending. Continue to process or blend, adding small amounts of the ice water as needed, until smooth.\nServe, topped with a sprig of mint leaves and/or lavender.",

      instructions:
        "<ol><li>The place to start is with the tapioca, the pudding is a custard. So, in a heavy bottomed saucepan add the full milk, salt, tapioca, the seeds from the vanilla pod, and the empty vanilla pod. Bring this mix to a gentle simmer and stir occasionally. Do this until the tapioca is translucent and tender, this takes about 20 minutes. When cooked, stir in the coconut milk.</li><li>While the tapioca mix is cooking you can whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl - quite big as it has to hold half of your tapioca mix too. Mix the egg and sugar together until the color lightens.</li><li>Taking your cooked tapioca mix from the heat, pour half of it into the bowl with the eggs and sugar, whisk together using a metal hand whisk. Then pour this back into the pan and place on a medium heat.</li><li>On a medium heat keep whisking until the mix thickens, this takes about 5 minutes or so. It is important not to use too high a heat as the eggs will scramble. The mix will not become really thick, the chilling process with thicken it further. I like to check the sweetness level at this stage, you can add a little more sugar if you wish, but if you do, stir it through until it dissolves. Put your tapioca pudding in a clean, cool bowl, remove the vanilla bean and set aside to cool. When it has cooled, cover with cling film and put in the fridge.</li><li>Now for the pineapple. Combine the fruit with the honey, lime juice and most of the zest. Keep back a little lime zest to dress.</li><li>Place half of the mix in a food processor and blend until smooth. Transfer this back into the bowl with the rest of the pineapple and stir together  check the flavour and add more honey or lime if you wish.</li><li>Once your tapioca has chilled, place some of the pineapple mix in the bottom of your serving dishes, then add the tapioca and top with a little pineapple and some lime zest to finish.</li></ol>",

        "INSTRUCTIONS\nSoak the dates in warm water for about 10 minutes. Drain.\nIn your food processor, combine pistachios, shredded coconut, cocoa powder, and salt. Pulse until finely ground.\nAdd in vanilla and the softened mejool dates and pulse until a ball forms.\nRoll into bite sized balls (mine were about  tablespoons) and dip immediately in to cocoa powder, shredded coconut, or my personal favorite dark chocolate that's been melted with a *hint* of coconut oil.\nEnjoy immediately! Store the leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge.\nNOTES\nCocoa powder is extremely bitter, so make sure you like the taste before rolling all of them in cocoa powder. My personal favorites are the shredded coconut or dark chocolate! :)",
